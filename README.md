# Random Password Generator

## Description 

This project was designed to help people create strong passwords using a random system. To do this, I included all upper and lower case letters, along with numbers and special characters.

The user first has the option to choose the overall length of characters that makes up their random password. Then the user will be prompted to choose to include the other character options. Finally the application will randomly generate a string of characters based on the user's preferred inputs.

I learned to combine inputs of different variables and produce a random output based on the inputs. I will be able to build on these skills and help people secure their private information.



## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

The only install that you will need if a basic web browser.


## Usage 

This Application is used by first clicking then red button labeled "Generate Password" 

The user then will be prompted to choose the overall length of characters that makes up their random password. Input must remain within 8-128 characters. If not, an alert will pop up like this:

Then there will be a series of pop up confirms to determine what other character sets the user would like to use. If none of the character options are chose, there will be an alert that looks like this

Here is an example of what a final password would look like if the user chose 20 characters and opted-in to all of the characters

Here is a snippet of code that I wrote for this project. This top half of this code is the alert that requires the user to choose at least one of the character sets.

Secondly is the function to randomly choose the output based on the overall password length.


## License

For this project I used the MIT Licence

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
